== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin different from other security plugins on the market? =
* Heck yes it is! Right off the bat you will notice our super intuitive interface - we made sure to design the interface so that it is user friendly and jam-packed with rich information. This plugin is fully compatible with WordPress 3.8 Parker and we promise to always keep our plugins up-to-date!

= Will this completely stop all attacks on my site? =
* Unfortunately, no. Although we strive to provide the best tools on the market to detect and prevent hacks, there is no way to virtually stop hackers from breaking in to your site. You can't stop people from spying on your house - you can only prevent them from committing crime by installing cameras and locking your doors. This same theory also applies to website security.

= What is 1-click hardening? =
* 1-click hardening is the feature that seals some of the most common vulnerabilities in WordPress sites in just 1-click. However, there are other vulnerabilities that are out of your control such as plugin and theme vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is always a good practice to keep everything up-to-date and only use plugins from trust-able sources.

= Where can I get some help if everything goes wrong? =
* Free support is available in the discussion forum on this page. If you are concerned about hosting malware, have a website that has been hacked, or would like a free vulnerability assessment - please don't hesitate to call us at 855-FIX-HACK (855-349-4225)!
